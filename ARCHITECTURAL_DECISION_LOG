# Why a course.json file
This is the config for the course. We can have multiple courses with the same codebase, but different course.txt files
The capability is not implemented yet, but is easy

# Why have a separate emails.txt file
I am not sure I am correct here... but it is easier to use.
The emails file isn't json. Its just a list of emails. That's much easier to edit and manage.
We can also (not implemented yet) override 'just the emails' file and have multiple lists

# Why not using git forks
I started with git forks, but found it hard to have a second git fork in the same organisation

#Why not using git branches
Because it gets hard to navigate, hard to work out what the status is and so on. It's good to give each student their own place.

# Why is the current repo the current master
The alternative is to have the remote github repo the current master. That is easier when
everything is working, but harder when debugging and making changes
I decided it was easier to have the current repo the current master, and then push to the remote repo when everything is working
